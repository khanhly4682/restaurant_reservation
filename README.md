# restaurant_reservation

Home Test For BACK-END DEVLOPER
Let’s imagine that you need to write a console application to support finding restaurant available
for reservation at a specific datetime for a reservation length (minute). Data is given in CSV file
attached, please design structure to models Restaurant and its ReservablePeriod, then parse and
store data into that structure.
The code must pass two tests:
1. Find restaurant open on Sunday, at 10:00 PM, reservation length is 45 minutes. Results
must be “Rạn Biển”
2. Find restuarant open on Monday, at 11:00 AM, reservation length is 30 minutes. Results
must be “Sài Gòn New” and “Rạn Biển”.
Notes:
* You should NOT use a full-featured framework, just plain code.
* No database, user interaction or other functionality is required (so no HTML/CSS/JavaScript); it
just needs to be code which runs and passes the tests
